                    <p class="lead">This project first started with wanting to include my interest in other cultures by learning more about Jesus Christ. It then evolved into adding my new learned skill and making this website in order to present the material of my project. As I was looking through different paintings of Christ, these four pictures really stood out to me. I was impressed by the way each adapted Christ into their own way to feel closest to Him, as well as implement their own cultural styles and ways of creating art. It is a sure sign of the talent our Heavenly Father has blessed them with.
